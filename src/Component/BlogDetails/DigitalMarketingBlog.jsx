            The time to start your digital marketing is now—but with a plan. So many businesses dive in without knowing who the audience is or what the overall goals are. In fact, this can be likened to attempting to find treasures without a map. Be it launching a product or giving your brand a boost, you do need a well-thought-out strategy if you are to succeed.
            </p>
            <h4>DO: Know Your Audience</h4>
            <p>Think about your readers. Who are they and what do they want? Research their behaviours, interests, and pain points. Tools like Google Analytics or social media insights will let you source this information. Knowing your audience better connects your message to them.</p>
            <p>If your audience is on Instagram, for example, then your content should be highly attractive. If they're more into LinkedIn, make your thoughtful leadership focused on industry trends.</p>
            <h4>DON'T: Underestimate the Power of Content</h4>
            <p>The backbone of any digital marketing campaign is content. Refrain from creating generic posts that offer nothing. Instead, create problem-solving content to empower your audience, answer questions, or even inspire them.</p>
            <p>Great things to use are blog posts, videos, and infographics. Just remember, keep it light, simple, and engaging. No one likes a wall of text or convoluted jargon anywhere.</p>
            <h4>DO: Optimise for Mobile</h4>
            <p>A lot of your audience probably is browsing on their phone. Make sure your website and ads look great on mobile devices. Test them out, and fix everything that's hard to navigate or slow to load.</p>
            <p>Mobile-friendly designs are  a must. Google indexes mobile-optimized websites higher, meaning wider exposure for you!</p>
            <h4>DON'T: Ignore Data and Analytics</h4>
            <p>Your campaign doesn't end with publishing. Keep track of performance metrics such as clicks, impressions, and conversions. That data will show what is working and what needs a little tweak. It's like driving a car without using your speedometer.</p>
            <p>For example, if your ad is not clicked on, then change the headline or image. Sometimes, small changes can make a big impact.</p>
            <h4>DO: Utilise Social Media</h4>
            <p>Social platforms aren't for just selfies, but for connecting with your audience, updating them on your life, and mostly for brand promotion. Use them to engage with followers, respond to comments and questions, and build trust.</p>
            <p>Consistency is key. Regular posting, with a tone that fits your brand, is important.</p>
            <h4>DON'T: Spam Your Audience</h4>
            <p>Nobody likes feeling bombarded with emails or irrelevant ads. Instead of quantity, focus on quality. Send messages that your audience really wants to see. For example, there are higher open rates for personalised emails. Use the names of your audience, as well as suggestions of products and services relevant to them.</p>
            <h4>Are you ready to master digital marketing?</h4>
            <p>Digital marketing isn't a sprint but a marathon. Focus on the audience, create value, and be in a constant process of improvement driven by data at the core of your campaigns.
