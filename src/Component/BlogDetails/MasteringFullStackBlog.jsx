              In today's technology-driven world, the art of full stack
              development opens several doors to a world of advantages. But what
              does it take to excel in this field, and what is it exactly? Be it
              a career one is eying in the domain of web development or
              upgrading one's existing skill set, knowing these essential skills
              and tools can give one an edge over others. Let's break it down
              step by step.
            </p>
            <h4>What Skills Do You Need to Become a Full Stack Developer?</h4>
            <p>
              The full stack development comprises two sides, namely front-end
              and back-end development. Full stack development is all about
              developing a website from what it looks like to how it works
              inside.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>HTML & CSS</strong> : These are basically the building
                blocks of any web page. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language,
                provides the structure of the content, while CSS, or Cascading
                Style Sheets, designs how it looks. Any full-stack developer
                begins with these because they are the basic foundation of
                front-end development.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>JavaScript</strong> : After you have the content and
                design in place, you spice things up with JavaScript. It gives
                life to a website by making a wide range of interactivity
                possible. A language that every aspiring full-stack developer
                should be aware of.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Back-end languages</strong> : Python or Node.js. While
                the front end is super important, what goes behind the scenes
                needs equal attention. These back-end languages deal with logic,
                database, and server-side operations. Python is very friendly
                for beginners. Node.js allows JavaScript to be used from top to
                bottom. Hence, it's the general favourite.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Must-Have Tools by Every Full Stack Developer</h4>
            <p>
              Having the right tools can really amplify your development
              process:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Git and GitHub</strong>: Version control is
                non-negotiable. Git helps manage code changes, while GitHub
                facilitates collaboration and project management.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Node Package Manager</strong>: npm is actually a package
                manager for JavaScript that helps you manage the packages and
                dependencies that you will need in developing projects.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> : It is a straightforward
                yet really versatile code editor with support for several
                languages and frameworks. Hence, it's one of the developers'
                favourite code editors.
              </li>
            </ul>
